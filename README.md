# JavaScript use:
### JavaScript will be utilized on the website to create interactive elements such as expandable and collapsible panels that reveal additional information. Examples include the hamburger menu, which displays various links when clicked, and accordions that expand downward to provide more detailed content.
---
### Notes:
* The down arrows ↓↓ indicates an accordion, a panel that expands downwards when clicked. This will provide additional information on the topic the accordion is attached to.
* The vertical ellipsis ⋮ represents a scroll button. This indicates that there is more information further down that cannot be visualized by a wire frame due to the limited size.
* The hamburger menu ☰ indicates the menu. When clicked, a panel will slide from the left side of the screen, providing more links. These links are miscellaneous, and only provide extra information, as most information in these links are not important to learning more about Minecraft (ex. Statistics or Meet the Creators)
