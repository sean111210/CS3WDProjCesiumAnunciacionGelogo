                    <p>This gamemode is similar to Survival Mode. However, your interaction is limited. You can interact with
                        all mobs, but you can only interact with certain objects like levers and doors, and place blocks only on 
                        certain other blocks. This gamemode is often used for custom maps, with the restrictions preventing 
                        players from cheating or griefing/destroying maps.

                        you cannot interact with blocks, entities, or their own inventory, as their hotbar is invisible. You
                        do not have a hunger or health bar in this gamemode.

                        whatever you want, with access to an infinite amount of blocks and items, and almost complete 
                        invulnerability.You can use items and blocks normally inaccessible to the player in Survival Mode, 
                        and can fly around, though you cannot clip through blocks and entities.

                    <h1>PEACEFUL</h1>
                    <p>Peaceful is the least challenging mode in Minecraft and it is created to be played easy. The appearance of hostile mobs is completely absent, your health is automatically replenished, and hunger does not deplete, hence you cannot die of starvation or beatings by the enemy. The mode is best suited to constructing, experimenting with, or introducing oneself to the mechanics of the game without the need to worry, though it hinders progress, since hostile mobs cannot drop items, so some objectives such as reaching the End cannot be achieved without modifying the difficulty.

                <div class="diff-panel" data-diff="easy">
                    <h1>EASY</h1>
                    <p>Easy presents elements of survival and is yet forgiving. Enemy crowds are created, but they do not cause much harm, and being hungry may decrease your health but cannot kill you. Zombies can hardly smash wooden doors, and negative status effects like poison will not be lethal. The challenge is good among beginners who would want to enjoy combat and survival without serious repercussions of errors.
                </div>
                <div class="diff-panel" data-diff="normal">
                    <h1>NORMAL</h1>
                    <p>Normal offers the typical Minecraft survival game and is the default setting of majority of worlds. Video enemies cause moderate damage with hostile mobs, and ignorance is capable of killing you in hunger, zombies can even break through wooden doors. Status effects are even fatal, and crowds can possess more sophisticated behaviors, like zombies calling reinforcements. This is a challenge of medium difficulty that must be trained and focused on yet not too hard to be accomplished by most players.

                <div class="diff-panel" data-diff="hard">
                    <h1>HARD</h1>
                    <p>Hard is a considerable difficulty and is meant to be played by the experienced players. Mobs are much more damaging, hunger wears out quicker and kills you, and zombies have always the ability to break wooden doors. The probability of meeting armored mobs, baby zombies, and other threatening types of them is larger, and whenever killed, villagers become zombie villagers. Boss fights are also more intense and survival cannot be achieved without a good strategy, planning and good equipment.
                </div>
                <div class="diff-panel" data-diff="hardcore">
                    <h1>HARDCORE</h1>
                    <p>Hardcore is a difficulty mode and not a standard one and is the last challenge in Minecraft. It is permanently fixed to Hard difficulty and has a single life to the player. After death, there is no reset button or the ability to lower the difficulty, and you can either delete the world or be a spectator. It is a very dangerous mode which requires carefulness, extensive planning and survival abilities, and it can only be played in the Java Edition of the game.
