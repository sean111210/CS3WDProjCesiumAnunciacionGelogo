                <h1>STRUCTURES</h1>
                <p> Structures are pre-generated buildings or formations found throughout the Minecraft world. They can range from simple villages and temples to 
                    towering bastions and fortresses. These structures often contain valuable and unique loot, as well as mobs that can pose a challenge to players.
                    It is important for players to know about these structures, as some of these often contain essential resources as well as loot that can boost
                    progression.

                    <p>Survival Mode is the default gamemode of Minecraft. In this gamemode, players have to survive,
                        building and crafting items, tools, and blocks. There is a health bar as well as a hunger bar
                        that slowly depletes over time, and an oxygen bar that appears when you are underwater. When you
                        run out of hearts in your health bar, you die and return to your spawn point.
                    </p>

                <div class="dim-panel" data-dim="nether">
                    <h1>NETHER</h1>
                    <p>This gamemode is similar to Survival Mode. However, your interaction is limited. You can interact with
                        all mobs, but you can only interact with certain objects like levers and doors, and place blocks only on 
                        certain other blocks. This gamemode is often used for custom maps, with the restrictions preventing 
                        players from cheating or griefing/destroying maps.

                <div class="dim-panel" data-dim="end">
                    <h1>THE END</h1>
                    <p>In Spectator Mode, you can effectively fly freely, clipping through blocks and entities. However,
                        you cannot interact with blocks, entities, or their own inventory, as their hotbar is invisible. You
                        do not have a hunger or health bar in this gamemode.
