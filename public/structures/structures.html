                <h1>STRUCTURES</h1>
                <p> Structures are pre-generated buildings or formations found throughout the Minecraft world. They can range from simple villages and temples to 
                    towering bastions and fortresses. These structures often contain valuable and unique loot, as well as mobs that can pose a challenge to players.
                    It is important for players to know about these structures, as some of these often contain essential resources as well as loot that can boost
                    progression.

                    <h1>OVERWORLD</h1>
                    <p>Due to the Overworld being similar to that of our own Earth, there are a multitude of structures to be found, that which cannot all be 
                        specified. However, they can be classified into different groups: underground, aboveground, and underwater structures. Underground
                        structures include any structures that can only generate underground, such as strongholds or ancient cities, while aboveground structures,
                        like jungle and desert temples, only generate on the surface of the Overworld. Lastly are underwater structures, like shipwrecks or ocean
                        monuments, can only spawn underwater.
                    </p>

                <div class="dim-panel" data-dim="nether">
                    <h1>NETHER</h1>
                    <p>Though the Nether is just as expansive as the Overworld, it has far fewer structures; only two, in fact: First is the Bastion Remnant. 
                        These humongous structures are ruins of citadels made of blackstone, filled with piglins and piglin brutes. These mobs guard the resources
                        that hide within the remains of these structures, including but not limited to diamond armor and tools, gold, and a very ancient ore.
                        Second is the Nether Fortress. These are towering castles made from nether brick, housing tall wither skeletons and blazes. In contrast
                        to the Bastion Remnants, the value of these fortresses lay not in the loot found within, but the mobs that walk its paths. Wither skeletons
                        and blazes drop valuable loot that is essential to find two of three great creatures.

                <div class="dim-panel" data-dim="end">
                    <h1>THE END</h1>
                    <p>With the End's desolate landscape, there is only one type of structure to be found here, and they are scattered few and far between. The End
                        cities are tall structures found in the End islands. The abandoned cities are infested with shulkers, and inside them is scattered loot
                        left by those who built this city. These structures may also be accompanied with a great ship called the End Ship, containing the 
                        head of the past Ender Dragons, and the wings that grant you true freedom; the elytra.
